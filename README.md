# Marketing Analytics – Competitive Positioning of Trader Joe’s Frozen Foods
This project evaluates the market positioning of Trader Joe’s frozen food segment relative to key competitors (Whole Foods 365, Walmart Great Value, Target Good & Gather, Costco Kirkland Signature). Using perceptual mapping, positioning analysis, and customer segmentation, the study highlights how Trader Joe’s can strengthen its competitive edge.

# Objectives
- Analyze Trader Joe’s brand perception on attributes like affordability, healthiness, uniqueness, taste, and convenience.
- Compare positioning against competitors using perceptual and positional mapping.
- Segment consumers into clusters to identify target groups.
- Provide strategic marketing recommendations.

# Methodology
1. Survey Design
- Collected consumer perceptions on value, taste, healthiness, convenience, and lifestyle alignment.
- Captured brand preference and demographic information.
2. Perceptual Mapping
- Used multidimensional scaling (MDS) to visualize how consumers perceive brands.
- Key dimensions identified:
  - Value vs. Quality (74.3% variance explained)
  - Convenience vs. Specialty (18%)
  - Price vs. Accessibility (6.8%)
3. Positioning Analysis
- Trader Joe’s scored high on taste, uniqueness, and healthiness.
- Walmart led affordability & convenience.
- Whole Foods dominated health perception but struggled with affordability.
4. Segmentation (K-Means Clustering)
- 3 consumer segments identified:
  - Segment 1 (34%): Older, familiar brand loyalists (Trader Joe’s, Costco).
  - Segment 2 (25%): Health-conscious, frequent buyers (Whole Foods).
  - Segment 3 (41%): Younger, price-sensitive shoppers (Walmart, Trader Joe’s).
 
# Key Findings
- Trader Joe’s is preferred overall (4.28 preference score).
- Strengths: Brand loyalty, taste, uniqueness, healthy image.
- Weaknesses: Mid-range pricing pressure from both premium and budget competitors.
- Opportunities: Expand product line (plant-based, protein-rich), improve digital marketing, optimize pricing & store accessibility.

# Recommendations
